    <b>HTML Markup</b><br>
    <p>An HTML Markup consists of tags which are designated by typing them between these symbols "< >".  Many tags have an opening tag and a closing tag.  The contents of the tag appear between the opening and closing tags.  The opening tag, content and closing tag are known as an "Element."</p>

    <p>Tags can be inline or block.  An inline tag changes the text on a line of text whereas a block tag usually ends by adding a blank line in the content.</p>

    <b>Examples of Inline Tags</b>
    1)  bold <br>
    2)  italics<br>
    3)  line break  --  NOTE:  This is also a "void" tag.<br>  
    4)  span<br>
    5)  img<br>
    6)  anchors<br><br>

    <b>Examples of Block Tags</b><br>
    1)  paragraph<br>
    2)  div<br><br>

    <b>It is not necessary to memorize the tags.  Rather, it is important to learn how they operate.  You can always look the tags up using a web search.</b><br>
